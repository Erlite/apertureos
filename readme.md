# Aperture OS

This repository will contain the configuration files, the wallpaper and other miscelaneous things that'll allow you to rice your distro like mine.

# How to install

Assuming you're on Linux, and assuming you have brain cells, copy each config into the corresponding file.
Example: `cat compton.conf > ~/.config/compton.conf`

Remember to make backups in case of problems.
